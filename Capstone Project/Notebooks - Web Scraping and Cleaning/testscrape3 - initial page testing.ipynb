It is breathtaking experience', 'Completely in awe of this and other sites of Lalibela and surrounds. We had a guided tour of the rock hewn churches and short trek with the impressive lalibelacrosstours.com Lots to do in this area of Ethiopia - 4 days. A must see destination.', 'From the moment the view is revealed as you walk towards it and as you descend in to the belly of the church especially as the sun sets can only be described as Amazing.', None, \"If you are in the town you must visit here, it might be the most visited but it's in a stunning setting.\", None, \"All the rock-hewn churches are incredible but if you can only see one (not sure why this would be but . . .) then St George's should be it.\", 'I saw the Church picture and videos for many times. And wishing to put my fingers on it. Yes, I did it finally & it’s quite attractive.', 'This is a church literally sculptured out of a mountain, both outside and inside. Difficult to say how they could possibly build it, definitely worth a visit.', 'all of the Churches in Lalibela are magnificent. Church of St George is perhaps the most camera friendly given the position and roof top decor. Very easy to traverse down into the Church and great history to be heard.', None, None, None, 'This church is particularly interesting because is has a square shape and an large under level surrounding. Worth the visit.', 'This is the most fascinating of the churches. It is the church often pictured in National Geographic when talking about Laibela. All the symbolisms of this church will fascinate anyone who knows the stories of the Bible.', 'For many people this may be one of the main reasons for visiting. Of course there is so much more, but this one carved building was amazing.', 'i was very happy and i felt like i am doing the right thing in my life .\\nthe building has its own drainage system just like modern architecture ....................................', None, None, 'This was the last church to be built and is the best. Worth at least two visits. Very good view of the church from the slight rise to the left as you walk out.', None, 'I was fortunate to attend a special celebration at daybreak. The crowd was so pious. The locals really believe that the water in the pond can cure all illnesses. It is definitely the highlight of my Lalibela visit.', None]\n",
